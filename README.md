# High-Performance K-Means (From Scratch)

This project implements a high-performance K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch
using Python and NumPy, without relying on machine learning libraries.

## Features
- Vectorized squared Euclidean distance
- K-Means++ initialization
- Custom Min-Heap and Hash Table
- Elbow Method for optimal K
- Benchmarking against scikit-learn

## Dataset
California Housing Prices Dataset (20,640 samples)

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Status
Implementation in progress.
